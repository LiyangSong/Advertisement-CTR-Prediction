# Introduction

A DS5220 final project applying supervised machine learning techniques to build and train models that can be used to predict `Click-Through Rate (CTR)`, a ratio showing the percentage of people who see ads or products end up clicking it.

In this project, we want to use `2020 DIGIX Advertisement CTR Prediction` dataset to build a model that improves advertising CTR prediction. The model can be integrated into the advertising serving system and will be used to predict the likelihood of a click for each available ad. And the system can then choose to display ad with the highest predicted CTR to the user, thereby potentially maximizing the actual clicks and revenue.
