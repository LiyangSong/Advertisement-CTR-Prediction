## EDA Plan (10/22)
1. Create a copy of the data for exploration. (Liyang)
2. Describe attributes basic info. (Liyang)
3. Identify target, numerical, categorical. (Liyang)
4. Missingness. (Liyang)
5. Outliers. (Liyang)
6. Usefulness for task (corraltion with target, variability) (Qian)
7. If numerical histogram and basic stats(mean, median, variance, max, min). If
categorical, cardinality and value counts. (Qian)
8. correlations and associations between attributes. (Qian)
9. Identify the promising transformations you may want to apply. (Liyang, Qian)
10. Document what you have learned. (Liyang, Qian)

## Data Preparation Plan (10/27)
1. Drop Outliers
2. Missingness (fill or drop)
3. Drop attributes (useless/high correlation)
4. Discretize continuous features
5. Decompose features
6. transformations of features
7. Aggregate into new features
8. Feature scaling
9. Document what you have learned. (Liyang, Qian)
