## EDA Plan (10/22)
1. Create a copy of the data for exploration. (Liyang)
2. Describe attributes basic info. (Liyang)
3. Missingness. (Liyang)
4. Identify target, numerical, categorical. (Liyang)
5. For numerical.
   - Distribution (Histogram, KDE plots, etc.). (Liyang)
   - Outliers detection (Box plots). (Liyang)
   - Correlations and associations between attributes. (Qian)
   - Usefulness for task (correlation with target, variability). (Qian)
6. For categorical.
   - Distribution (bar plots, etc.). (Qian)
   - Cardinality and value counts. (Qian)
7. Identify the promising transformations you may want to apply. (Liyang, Qian)
8. Document what you have learned. (Liyang, Qian)

## Data Preparation Plan (10/27)
1. Drop Outliers
2. Missingness (fill or drop)
3. Drop attributes (useless/high correlation)
4. Discretize continuous features
5. Decompose features
6. transformations of features
7. Aggregate into new features
8. Feature scaling
9. Document what you have learned. (Liyang, Qian)
